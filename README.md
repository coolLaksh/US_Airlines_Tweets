Sentiment Analysis on US Airlines Tweets
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of US airlines tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the text. We have employed various preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we aim to classify tweets about US airlines into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. This information can provide valuable insights into customer opinions and help airlines improve their services.

Data
We used a dataset containing tweets about US airlines. The dataset includes various attributes such as tweet text, airline, sentiment, and more. We focused on the text and airline_sentiment columns for sentiment analysis.

Preprocessing
Before building the classification model, we performed several preprocessing steps on the tweet text:

Cleaning: Removed special characters, URLs, and irrelevant information from the text.
Tokenization: Split text into individual words (tokens).
Lowercasing: Converted all tokens to lowercase for uniformity.
Stopwords Removal: Removed common stopwords that don't contribute much to sentiment analysis.
Stemming: Reduced words to their root forms using stemming techniques.
Feature Extraction
We used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to convert the cleaned and preprocessed text into numerical features. TF-IDF assigns weights to words based on their importance in the document and across the corpus.

Model Development
We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression. After conducting hyperparameter tuning, we found that Logistic Regression performed the best in terms of accuracy.

Evaluation
The performance of the final model was evaluated on both validation and test datasets. The results are as follows:

Validation Accuracy: 0.9183673469387755
Test Accuracy: 0.9228662711090826
The achieved accuracy indicates the model's ability to correctly classify sentiments in US airlines tweets.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis on US airlines tweets. By accurately categorizing sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, airlines can gain insights into customer feedback and make informed decisions to improve their services.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning algorithms to further enhance the model's performance and gain deeper insights from the data.
